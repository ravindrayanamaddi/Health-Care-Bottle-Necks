# 🏥 Patient Flow Optimization BI System

A complete **Business Intelligence (BI) Dashboard** built using **Streamlit**, designed to analyze hospital patient flow, identify bottlenecks, optimize staffing, and improve operational efficiency.

---

## 📌 Overview

The **Patient Flow Optimization System** provides:

* 📊 Executive-level KPIs
* 🔍 Bottleneck detection
* 👨‍⚕️ Staffing & resource optimization
* 🤖 AI-powered chatbot for insights
* ⭐ Star Schema-based data modeling

This system helps hospital administrators make **data-driven decisions** to reduce wait times and improve patient care.

## 🧱 Architecture

### ⭐ Data Model (Star Schema)

**Fact Tables:**

* `Fact_DeptLogs` → Patient movement & timestamps
* `Fact_Staffing` → Staff availability

**Dimension Tables:**

* `Dim_Patients` → Patient details
* `Dim_Visits` → Visit-level info
* `Dim_Departments` → Department metadata
* `Dim_Calendar` → Date & time hierarchy

---
